# Does the health check notice when the GAME dies and the wrapper does not?
#
# The server binary is `ProjectZomboid64`; a comm file holds fifteen
# characters, so the name on disk reads `ProjectZomboid6` and an exact
# match on the full name would never be green. The check anchors the
# start of the line instead. The wrapper is `entry.sh`, which shares no
# text with it, so a substring form does not lie here - the anchor is
# kept so it cannot start to.
#
# Docker does not restart an unhealthy container by itself, so a check that
# stays green with the game dead is a check nobody else corrects.
#
# No game download involved: two processes with the right names are enough,
# and the check reads /proc, not the game.
